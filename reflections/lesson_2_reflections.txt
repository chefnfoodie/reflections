What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository in our local directory with .git class in it the github uses it as an identifier to checkin.

use git add to add files to intermediate staging area from working directory to commiting in repository.then use git commit to repository.

git reset can remove the files from staging area.
