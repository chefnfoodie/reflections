What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository in our local directory with .git class in it the github uses it as an identifier to checkin.

use git add to add files to intermediate staging area from working directory to commiting in repository.then use git commit to repository.

git reset can remove the files from staging area.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It allows us to see what files we are about to commit and delete them if necessary .

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
we can use the git diff  and git diff â€”staged to see the differences of staging area with working directory and commit 1 of repository.Any extra untracked changes can be git reset.
